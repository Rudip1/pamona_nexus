# cad_assets_studio

The **asset workshop** for Pomona's Gazebo simulation. This is where 3D assets
are authored, processed, and previewed *before* they become Gazebo models.

> Two layers — keep them separate:
> - **Studio (here)** = source `.blend`, processing scripts, intermediate
>   `.obj/.dae/.stl`, textures, render previews, throwaway check worlds.
> - **Product** = `src/pomona_gazebo/models/<name>/` — the clean, self-contained
>   `model.config` + `model.sdf` + `meshes/` that Gazebo actually loads.
>
> Gazebo only ever loads the *product*. The studio is the factory.

```

## Conventions

- **File naming:** `<crop>_<state>_<NN>` → e.g. `strawberry_mildew_03.obj`.
- **Editable source = `.blend`** for mesh/art assets (plants); **= the Python
  build script** for parametric CAD (the UV-C cantilever — STL is just output).
- **Studio MTLs** reference `../textures/...`. When a mesh is promoted to a
  Gazebo model, **copy** the needed textures next to the mesh and use
  `textures/...` so the model is self-contained and survives `colcon` install.

## Making a clean .blend (important)

Never reopen an untrusted downloaded `.blend` as a "source." Build a fresh one
from the safe OBJ instead (OBJ carries geometry only, no executable code):

```bash
blender --background --python tools/obj_to_blend.py -- \
  strawberry/meshes strawberry/source/strawberry_plants.blend "strawberry_plant_0*.obj"
```

## Provenance / attribution

- **strawberry** plants: extracted from a BlenderKit "Strawberry Garden Planter"
  model (pot + soil removed), re-textured into ripe/half-ripe/unripe/flowering
  and two diseases (powdery mildew, leaf scorch).
- **maize / weeds / stones / markers:** `goldmines/virtual_maize_field-ros2-gz`.
- **bed / dirt_plane / berry meshes:** `goldmines/harvester-sim-master` (BSD).
- **tomato / ground:** `goldmines/fields-ignition-noetic`.

## ⚠️ Security note

The original `Strawberry_Garden_Planter.blend` (and its `uploads_` copy)
contained an **auto-running malicious script** that beaconed to throwaway
Cloudflare-worker domains on open. Those `.blend` files were **deleted**. All
meshes here were extracted with `--disable-autoexec` and exist only as
code-free `.obj/.dae/.stl` + a clean re-built `.blend`. **Do not re-import any
copy of that planter `.blend`.**
